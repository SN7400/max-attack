Rally Series is to fulfill the mission of the RSGA by raising the level and awareness of meaningful two-wheel-drive competition in North America. The Rally Sports Group of America will pay out a significant cash purse to be divided amongst the fastest teams competing in the MaxAttack! Rally Series each year. RSGA seeks to provide an attainable and sustainable entry point into performance rally, resulting in broader awareness and increased participation in the sport.</p>  <p><b>The Term MaxAttack!</b></p>  <p>The term MaxAttack! comes from the expression Maximum Attack. It's roots are in the lexicon of the World Rally Championship drivers from the 1980s. After each day of rally the television reporters would interview the drivers to get their comments on the days rallying and perhaps some insight on their strategy for the next day. Often times a driver had to make up time on another driver or defend a lead which would require driving at 100% of a driver's ability, hurtling their cars as fast as they possibly could over the rocks, jumps, and through hairpin corners as they were cheered on by throngs of wild rally fans on the sides of the roads.. In this case when asked by the press how they would be proceeding the next day the answer, which foretold of maximum speed, flirting with risk, and an absolutely fearless attitude for the next day, was simply Maximum Attack.</p>  <hr /><p><a name="rsga" id="rsga"><h2>About RSGA</h2></a></p>  <p>The Rally Sports Group of America, Inc. (RSGA) was formed as a non-profit organization in 2006 to advance the sport of performance stage rally in the United States. By providing education on performance driving, car preparation, and safety, and by fostering the growth of meaningful competition, RSGA seeks to provide an attainable and sustainable entry point into performance rally, resulting in broader awareness and increased participation.</p>  <p>One of the primary means of achieving this mission is by the creation of the MaxAttack! Rally Series. This series will help participating two-wheel-drive rally teams learn team marketing skills and improve technical aspects of driving and safe car preparation. It will also help educate teams by outlining strategies that will help increase the sustainability of their rally efforts.</p>  <hr /><p><a name="rally" id="rally"><h2>About Rally Racing</h2></a></p>  <p>Rally racing is the purest form of racing. It's a racecourse is composed of closed down real roads. Events can last several days and cover hundreds of miles through rain, snow, mud and dust. It's whatever mother nature decides during the day or through the night. Many in other forms of racing consider rally drivers to be the best all around drivers in the world. Any road surface and every weather condition must be mastered while possessing the wherewithal necessary to make it through arduous hours and hundreds of miles. An experienced veteran once said "Circuit racers see 10 turns 1000 times while rally drivers see 1000 turns 1 time!</p>  <p>A major part of a driver's success is their co-driver. Rally drivers cannot practice the course and must rely on their navigator (or co-driver) to succeed. The co-driver uses a computerized odometer along with a supplied route book in order to communicate to the driver what lies ahead on the road. The route book describes in detail the road ahead and includes warnings for hazards such as dips, rocks, cliffs, trees and even water crossings. It is up to the driver to process this information along with what the driver sees ahead to determine how best to attack the course. After all it's a race and they are racing against many other teams!</p>  <p>Rally cars must be strong enough to survive hundreds of miles and several days of conditions that would quickly destroy an unprepared vehicle . An additional element to their preparation is keeping them street legal since they must traverse public roads with traffic between the competitive timed sections. In the MaxAttack! Rally Championship any vehicle could potentially be a rally car as long as it meets the scrutineering requirements of the events and is two wheel drive.</p>  <p>Old rutted logging roads and well groomed forest roads as well as the chance paved road make up what is the course for a rally. They are temporarily closed, real roads on which rally drivers can go as fast as they can. The manpower needed to make sure the course is safe and administrate the rally is provided by volunteers. Many volunteers are needed to make an event successful. The coordination and determination of these voulunteers is a huge challenge and the RSGA salutes the efforts of these people who make the events possible.</p>  <p>There is no other experience like spectating a rally in the forest in person. Fans get to line the road and get close to the action. Cars hurtle down the forests roads, seemingly out of control as they pitch and slide through bumps and corners. Fans can also visit the service areas where drivers and their teams repair the cars before heading back to the special stages in the forest. The best thing about the experience is it's totally free.</p>  <hr /><p><a name="lifestyle" id="lifestyle"><h2>About The Rally Lifestyle</h2></a></p>  <p>Performance Rally is a special sport. In addition to the incredible driving, amazing rally cars there is a special mentality needed to compete and keep going just to finish an event, let alone compete for a win. Rallies often run over hundreds of miles of forested, rural, and urban areas and over multiple days.</p>  <p>The people that make up a rally team are a special breed. Extreme mental and physical endurance are needed from the driver and co-driver. Incredible work by the team mechanics is vital in order to fix cars that have incurred damage from the rough and unforgiving course and have managed to "limp" their cars back to the service areas. The drivers, co-drivers, and service crews all have to be willing to keep trying even if the car needs something as major as a transmission swap. The term "quit" does not apply to the team members. Unfortunately, due to the rough nature of the sport, the term will sometimes apply to the rally car if the mechanical damage exacted by the course is unfixable.</p>  <p>Regardless of whether the car finishes or not there is always work to be done on the car between races. A well maintained car will finish rallies. Hours are spent by teams and car owners in order to make sure every last detail of performance and durability are as good as they can be as the pounding will continue at the next rally. This is an untold story of dedication.</p>  <p>Performance Rally teams are living a special lifestyle. It's a commitment one makes to be a rally racer that means that ultimate effort will be put forth on the stage, at the service areas, and between races. The relationship between car and team becomes much more than just that of a car and owner. Untold hours are spent trying to engineer a solution to a slight problem or modification to make the car stronger and more likely to lead the team to the finish of the rally. It's man versus machine and nature. It's an addiction to challenge and problem solving combined with a lust for adrenaline.</p></ul></div></div></div>  </div>
