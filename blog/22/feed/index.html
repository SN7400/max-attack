 <title>Oh, owning a racecar</title>

 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, it&#039;s a week before I plan on leaving for Ojibwe. The car is running fairly well, still leaks a little oil but runs nice. With the help of a friend I just put in a new clutch and replaced the front brake rotors and lines. Now, I have no brake pressure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To answer the obvious question: yes, I bled the brakes. Then bled them again. And again. And again. Then replaced the master cylinder, and bled them yet another time. The pedal still goes to the floor and no, there are no leaks. Off to a friend&#039;s house to get the brakes vacuum bled. Hopefully that works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
